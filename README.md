# README

Clone this repository on a local environment running Ruby.

This project is based on Ruby 2.6.3, so it is better to run with that version.
If you do not have this version, you may try to update the file `.ruby-version`. 

The project is based on SQlite, as a result you do not need to install any SQL server. There is no configuration needed.
